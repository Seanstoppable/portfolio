  Hello! My name is Sean Smith. I am a backend oriented engineer with over 13 years of experience building APIs and integrations.
  I am currently Director of Architecture at SecurityScorecard.

  I like learning about the industry I work in and leveraging technology
  to solve real world business problems.
  My preference is to use good tools to build great things. I don't shy away
  from building something from nothing as needed, but I'd rather focus on actual
  business problems than build my own framework from scratch.

  Congrats on making it this far! Other interesting facts: I like making pickles,
  have founded beer AND a whiskey clubs at previous jobs, and love board games of every kind.

  I'm also fasciniated by security, both physical and electronic, having previously written a weekly roundup of trends for two years.
