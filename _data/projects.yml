    into more consumable tidbits for coworkers and other interested parties.

    Contributor to my friend's initiative for curating great content on the
    subject of leading and managing.
    Geared towards people coming from the tech space, as many engineers tend to
    find themselves thrust into managerial roles.

    A command line tool to programatically clean up a gmail inbox
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Tired of cleaning out large inboxes by hand, I instead wrote an application
    where I could set up rules to automate cleanup.
    Since part of my desire was time based filters, which Gmail does not support,
    my option was to do it myself.
    This was an exploration in Golang and the Gmail API.
